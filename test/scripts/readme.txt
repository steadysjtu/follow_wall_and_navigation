I wrote various kinds of python files to accomplish different tasks. The basic files are follow_the_wall_on_right.py and navigation.py, the first one is to follow the wall, the second one is to navigate to the terminal.When the camera finds the color I want,then it publish a topic which msg's type is Bool.And then the follow_wall part is shut down, the navigation part gets the msg and then start to navigate.
